# rScreen
##A screen recoder for Windows based on ffmpeg

This software is created to record Windows screen. It depends on ffmpeg.

Usage:
```bash
rScreen --time [time_in_secs] --file [file_path_to_save]
```

This would create a video file named file_path_to_save (you can use anything like a.avi, or b.mp4, etc.). And the video records time_in_secs seconds of video stream of the screen.
